## Project Context

This project is the next step of [the previous project here](https://github.com/IchfanKurniawan/quantium-intern-project).  

You are part of Quantiumâ€™s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, has asked us to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.  

The client has selected store numbers 77, 86 and 88 as the treatment stores and run the experimentation on start of February 2019 - end of April 2019. Let's analyze if the new layout influences the store performance.

## Summary

Store numbers 77, 86, and 88 has been changed the layouts for experimentation in the trial period (Feb 2019 - Apr 2019). By using the t-test independent method, the daily sales of the treatment stores are compared to the control stores.  
Null-hypothesis:there is no difference of daily sales between treatment store & control store in the trial period  

Alternative-hypothesis: there is a difference of daily sales between treatment store & similar store in the trial period  

The results show that for all of treatment stores, there are no statistically significance (p-value > 0.05) differences between the treatment stores & the control stores. The results of t-test are as follow:  

| Analysis      | Statistics | p-value |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Store 77      | -1.798       | 0.073       |
| Store 86      | -1.581       | 0.115       |
| Store 88      | -1.694       | 0.091       |
